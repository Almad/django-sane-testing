Lukas Linhart <bugs@almad.net> is primary author of this library.

However, code and/or inspiration has been taken from other generous
open-source authors, listed in arbitrary order:

Mikeal Rogers is an contributor to windmill. A while ago, he posted me
a snipped on how to integrate CherryPy WSGI with Django. Later, he included
similar thing in Windmill. Live server plugin is based on those codes.

Jeff Balogh wrote a patch for Django's #12671. Snippets from this patch
(commited in http://code.djangoproject.com/changeset/12306) were used for
flushing cache part.

Jason Pellerin wrote the nose testing framework that made this library
possible. Also, he wrote propagation methods for making unittest assert
methods available.
